# Game of 24

Using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, create 24 from 4 given numbers. The 4 numbers are randomly generated and solutions are pre-computed using an algorithm in order to guarantee that every card has a solution.

The game can also be played with numbers other than 24, so before starting the game, the user may choose any number between 1 and 24 for solving.
